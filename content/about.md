## What It's All About

**Reports** is a blog written by John Lecocq that will, hopefully, be used as a tool for informing decision making of all types. In it you will find articles that simplify topics from recommended dietary intake of nutrients for various age groups to the value of drugs confiscated by US federal authorities. All of the reports follow the same thread as they all explore large data sets looking to uncover meaningful insights.

## Collaboration

If you find that important factors have been left out of a report, then contact the email listed at the bottom of the page or use the "Edit This Page" feature included in the top right of each report. It is the goal of the author to foster a collaborative environment that uncovers truth, together.

## Purpose

What you will get from this blog is:

- Reports using data that comes from and helps characterize complex systems of the world

- Short videos, images, and figures that cultivate deeper insights into a topic

- Examples of how anyone can gather insights from publicly available data

## Goals

To inspire and empower others to critically examine topics based on data. To bring about an awareness will lead to a more informed public. It is the belief of the author that information is essential for understanding. 

## Final Note

It has been through the pursuit of true information that one grows wise. No one is perfectly wise, and we must always be aware that anyone, even ourselves, are capable of making mistakes. With that in mind, let us go off and figure out a better way together. 

# Looking forward to hearing from you
