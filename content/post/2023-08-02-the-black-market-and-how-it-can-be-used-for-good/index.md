The US black market is the sum of all un-taxed economic activity. Sounds great! Where do I sign up? Right... Well, the catch is that it is illegal. Despite this fact, it is still enormous. This article discusses:


- Economic activity that makes up black markets
- Estimated size of the US black market
- How that relates to other countries
- How the white market can compete
- Why this matters

# Black Market Basics

# Estimated Size

How does one estimate the size of the black market?

# Solutions

The amount of money that can be generated is immense. A great solution will reduce black market size and increase white market size. This cannot be done by allowing drugs to be legalized for use, as we know from the pacific NW. They are still a liability for anyone providing them. So, what we do is use the existing infrastructure of the US healthcare system, and reduce the burden on the healthcare professionals prescribing the drugs. The plan is simple:

- Big pharmaceutical companies should be expanded to produce the most popular street drugs
- They should hire production and quality control staff
- They must lower their costs to compete with the black market
- Drug stores dispense the drugs to anyone that asks for them
- Anyone purchasing the drugs must be of a certain age and consent to the health, legal risks involved
- Educate people on what they are taking and how it can affect them
- Collect taxes on drug sales and related economic activity

I know that it sounds a bit out there to recommend drug companies should help put the black market out of business, but this is a start. It is true that we also need to work on reducing human trafficking and illegal firearm sales. That will come at a later time. For now, let's just discuss why all of this even matters?

# Why This Matters

It can be reasoned that black transactions reduces inflation because they represent dollars leaving the money supply. However, there is money laundering.

Economic activity that is untaxed.

Profit for pharmaceutical companies. New jobs. More taxable transactions.

Other crimes associated with black market transactions. People get ripped off, and take the law into their own hands.
