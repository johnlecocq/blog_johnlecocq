# Renewable Energy and Net Zero

One of the most popular topics of conversation is the weather. At least it is for me. As a Floridian, I love to talk about the weather. In the cooler months, we talk about how beautiful it is and how lucky we are to not be somewhere that it is cold. In the hot months, we talk about the need for rain, how much we are sweating and how we can't wait for the heat to be gone.

The weather is a determining factor for much of human activity. Is it going to rain at the wedding? Will the hurricane hit directly or are we to be spared? Is the weather safe to drive in? This is why we care so much about it, obviously. 

In addition to normal weather conversations it is also popular to hear how the weather is getting worse. We hear from politicians, conservationists and the media that human beings, especially those in developed countries are disrupting normal weather patterns for the worse. Mainly, what I hear most about is carbon, and how society should air to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to reduce increasing temperatures and the incidence and severity of natural disasters. 

So, I wanted to understand this a bit better. The topics that I will discuss in this report are as follows:
1. Compare historical weather patterns with current patterns (this will likely be very difficult)
2. Expand on how CO<sub>2</sub> can cause changes in the weather.
3. Explore "Net Zero" and the proposed pathway towards it.

# Macroscopic indicators of weather

To compare today's weather to the past we must have measurable qualities to compare. The qualities maintain the same definition, no matter when they were measured, which allows a fair comparison. Included in this discussion are temperature, chemical composition of the atmosphere, frequency and severity of natural disasters.

### Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules. 

When measuring the temperature of the air, what is being reported by the thermometer is how much energy the molecules in that air space have due to their motion. Molecules can move in the air (fast or slow), they can rotate or vibrate. Each of these modes of movement is how the molecules, which make up the air, store kinetic energy. If the average kinetic energy of molecules is high, then the air will feel hot, and the temperature will be high.

### Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of several molecules which compose the atmosphere. 

According to the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA), the *dry* atmosphere is mainly composed of gaseous nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), argon (1%) and carbon dioxide (0.035%) [The Atmosphere, NOAA, 2023](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere). These percentages are lower when the atmosphere is more saturated with water vapor. Nitrogen keeps the earth from burning up due to oxygen and is a major atomic constituent of molecular proteins found in all life. Oxygen is the fuel for combustion and animal energy production (cellular respiration). Carbon dioxide is consumed by plants, during photosynthesis, for their energy production. 

### Tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, forest fires, floods are all forms of natural disasters.

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, more frequently impact warm, coastal areas and forest fires occur more frequently in areas with plenty of dry vegetation. All natural disasters occur to varying degrees of severity and we measure their severity using scales. [Hurricanes are categorized 1-5](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php) based on their wind speed, earthquakes are rated based on [how much they cause a seismograph to move](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquake-magnitude-energy-release-and-shaking-intensity) and forest fires are often categorized by how much [land area they burn in total](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/8/22/back-to-school-burn-the-science-of-wildfires/).

# Historical weather comparison

### Temperatures in Fort Myers, Florida since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century

There is some data available that was captured at the Ft. Myers, Florida airport. There is more than 120 years of data available from the same location. It might be fitting, then, to look at this data to get an idea of how temperatures are changing in time in that area. The graph below shows the cumulative sum of days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit since 1892 in black with a linear model approximating this data overlaid in red. The cumulative sum was chosen to make it easier to detect relative increases or decreases. If the number of days above 90 was exactly equal for every year since 1892 in Ft. Myers, then the data would form a perfectly straight line when plottted as a cumulative sum.

The number of days above 90 appears to vary against the mean (line plotted in red). In the later part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, there appears to be fewer days above 90 recorded. Then, there is a sudden jump in the number of days above 90 around 1915. The days above ninety for every year appears to be increasing since about the mid-1990's which is seen as the black data points being above the red line.

### Two questions (1) was south Florida much cooler, on average, before 1915 and (2) what happened in the mid-1990's that could explain the obsevered increase above the traditional norm?

# Greenhouse gasses and carbon

Greenhouse gasses are those that trap heat in the atmosphere [US EPA, Overview of Greenhouse Gases](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases). Heat is a form of energy that translates into the kinetic energy of a molecule. In the case of the atmosphere, heat speeds up the translational, vibrational and rotational speeds gas molecules. According to the definition of a greenhouse gas, all gasses are greenhouse gasses because they all are able to store heat as kinetic energy. However, the proposed problem is not the current greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, but it is the gasses that are emitted into the atmosphere. That is the idea of Net Zero. 

# Net Zero

Net zero is a term used frequently, so let's define it here. The United Nations define Net Zero as a state in which there are zero carbon emissions left in the atmosphere after accounting for how much is captured by natural and artificial means [United Nations, Net Zero Coalition](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition). What would that mean? That means to cut back on the major carbon emitters on earth. Then, the atmosphere would have less capacity to store heat. 

However, I can't help but wonder how less storage capacity for heat in the atmosphere would cool the earth. There is an amount of heat that will available to the earth in either way. I suppose that is why some tests are being done on tech that can [block out the sun](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/02/climate/global-warming-clouds-solar-geoengineering.html).

Thinking about a solution: adding more gasses to the atmosphere would lower the average kinetic energy of the atmosphere as long as the gasses added were at a lower kinetic energy than the average of the atmosphere. Imagine you had a half cup of water and you heated it in the microwave. Then you added cool water to that cup. The average temperature of the water would be reduced. 

**It is reasonable, to me, that gasses are not the issue here. It is the emitter, which is hot. Heat is really the issue.**

### What are the major emitters of heat on earth? Also, what are the major heat sinks?

What emits heat? Well, literally everything. Any time you move, any time a molecule of air slows down against a wall when the breeze blows into it. So, what are the major producers of heat?

1. The sun
2. 

An obvious first guess at the major heat sink would be the ocean. This is why temperatures rising in the oceans is a predictor of heat.
