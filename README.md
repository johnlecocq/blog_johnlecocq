# blog_johnlecocq

The source code for a website run by John Lecocq. It was created in 08/23. It is a place to share and collaborate on reports. 

The code is separated by folders which when accessed using blogdown will render a webpage/blog. The reports can be found in the /content/posts/ folder. Reports are written in Markdown and RMarkdown which ultimately render as HTML.

The Hugo theme used for this blog is Yihui Xie's "XMag." The subtle design elements, like a newspaper, mixed with great postcards is what intriuged me about this theme. Xie is also the creator of RMarkdown and Blogdown, which are essential for the creation of this website. As I mention Yihui Xie, I should also mention Hadley Wickham and the rest of the R team. Also, I learned R and the Tidyverse for Statistics for BME from Kyle Allen and Damon Lamb. All of that work to get me to a website, thank you all.
